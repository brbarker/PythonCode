# Deck of Cards

The code was written using the Raspberry Pi python tutorial linked here --> (https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/deck-of-cards/0)

My goal is to explore object oriented programming and to explore a problem that I've been puzzling over for years. I haven't done much research on it because I'm using it as a thought experiment and test of my own skills, but I'm curious about how many perfect shuffles it would take to get a brand new deck of cards back into the exact order it was at the start.

Things to define:
  A Perfect Shuffle: Splitting a deck exactly in half and using a Riffle Shuffle where exactly one card from each half-deck goes down at a time, in order --> (R1,L1,R2,L2,R3,L3)
  Starting Order: All suits grouped together in this order --> (hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades). Hearts and clubs are ordered (Ace through King). Diamonds and Spades are ordered (King through Ace).
